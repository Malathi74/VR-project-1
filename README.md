2.Binding objects to JavaScript functions (using onlick="functionName()")

3.Using Document Object Model works (DOM)

4.Front-end design techniques that greatly take into consideration UX

5.How to manipulate 3-D .gltf models

6.General JavaScript library usage

7.This is individual project which boost my confidence 

#### Challenges Faced:

1.I have taken more time to position models but later I was able to do quickly because of practise

2.I have tried to play TV but sometimes video is not displaying. still I need to check this issue.


#### Contributors:

Individual project; All work was completed by Malathi Kadipikonda.

#### Description:

I have created a room where i have been during lockdown of covid19. I have added items TV,computer,speakers,bicycle,sofa, decorated items, clock, fan, light etc. which were in my room.

#### Differences due to covid:

1. Many baskets with fruits are kept in room because I couldn't go out everytime when I need food items that's the reason for more amount of fruits.

2. You can observe sanitizer and mask on table which is beside door so every time when i come from outside,I use sanitizer.

3. We can see masks on bike, whenever I go out by bike,I won't forget mask as it is already placed.
